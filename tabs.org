Managing tabs and spaces seems terrible difficult because there are
so many contexts in to consider. In this document we are setting some
defaults.

In text mode we want to insert only tabs
#+begin_src
(define-key text-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'tab-to-tab-stop);
#+end_src

The =tab-width= set to 4 and we redefine the =tab-stop-list= accordingly.

#+begin_src
(setq tab-width 4)
(setq tab-stop-list (number-sequence 4 120 4))
#+end_src
