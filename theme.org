One can experiment with themes by using the following commands.

1. =M-x load-theme= loads a predefined theme. Tab-completion is
   provided.
2. =M-x disable-theme= reverts back to the default theme.

I like the pre-installed them tango-dark.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-theme 'tango-dark t)
#+end_src
