Although you can get used to it a little bit unnerving to see the
cursor jump.

We found a nice [[http://zhangda.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/customize-emacs-automatic-scrolling-and-stop-the-cursor-from-jumping-around-as-i-move-it/][blog post]] that counters this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq scroll-margin 1
      scroll-conservatively 0
      scroll-up-aggressively 0.01
      scroll-down-aggressively 0.01)
#+end_src
