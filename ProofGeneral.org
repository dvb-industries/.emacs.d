[[http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/][ProofGeneral]] is a

#+begin_quote
generic front-end for proof assistants (also known as interactive
theorem provers), based on the customizable text editor Emacs.
#+end_quote

It needs to be [[http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/download][downloaded]] and placed in the =~/.emacs.d/=
directory. We will load if it is present, otherwise we will just
continue.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(let
    ((dir (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/ProofGeneral/")))
  (if (file-exists-p dir)
      (load-file (concat dir "generic/proof-site.el"))
    (message "not present %s" dir)))
#+end_src
