Autocompletion is a very cool feature that transform Emacs more and
more into a fully fledged integrated developement environment.

* Installation
We have installed autocomplete with the package manager. Take a look
at [[https://github.com/dvb-industries/.emacs.d/blob/master/packages.org][packages.org]].

* Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'auto-complete-config)
(ac-config-default)
#+end_src

In order to make it work seamlessly with =yasnippet= it seems that it
is necessary to set the variable =ac-source-yasnippet= to =nil= as
seen in this [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15774807/emacs-24-autocomplete-yasnippet][stackoverflow question]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ac-source-yasnippet nil)
#+end_src
